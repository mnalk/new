This example shows a linked bubble map and temporal histogram of migrant deaths. Brushing in the date view filters the data shown in the map. Panning and zooming in the map filters the data shown in the time view. This is a combination of the previous examples [Migrant Deaths Map](http://bl.ocks.org/curran/81271937fa94fdbdd854) and [Crossfilter & Chiasm](http://bl.ocks.org/curran/87d038562333a7ad4a64).

The data is from [themigrantsfiles.com](http://www.themigrantsfiles.com/), exported to [CSV format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) from this [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YNqIzyQfEn4i_be2GGWESnG2Q80E_fLASffsXdCOftI/edit#gid=686199832) on September 14, 2016. Each row of the table is represented as a red circle on the map. Unfortunately, the data collection project was discontinued in July 2016.
